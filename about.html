        <section style="margin-bottom:2rem;">
            <p style="line-height:1.8; margin-bottom:1rem;">Congratulations! You’ve stumbled onto something rare: A writer in his nascent period. A point in a writer’s life where he isn't really good yet.</p>
            <p style="line-height:1.8; margin-bottom:1rem;">But thankfully, you're curious. And due to your natural inclination to look under the surface, you've spotted something… potential, maybe. The early shimmer of something real. That shine found in someone just starting out, burning with ideas and hungry for the craft.</p>
            <p style="line-height:1.8; margin-bottom:1rem;">Why am I worth your time and money, you ask? I don’t suppose I am. Not in any grand sense. Not in the way things are usually measured.</p>
            <p style="line-height:1.8; margin-bottom:1rem;">But you’ve seen something. Maybe it's the hungry way I look at you. Maybe I remind you of a younger version of yourself — standing where I stand now: uncertain of the future, aware of how far there is to go.</p>
            <p style="line-height:1.8; margin-bottom:1rem;">I have no guarantees to offer you. No flash. No sales pitch. Only this: I believe in what I’m doing. I wake up thinking about it. I go to bed wondering if I did it well enough. I’m trying to create something honest. Something that lasts longer than both of us.</p>
            <p style="line-height:1.8;">If that counts for anything — then maybe I’m worth your time after all.</p>

            <p style="line-height:1.6;">Tom Dickinson (b. 2000) is a proud Tasmanian Aboriginal screenwriter from lutruwita/Tasmania, currently based in Naarm/Melbourne, where he is completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Screenwriting at the Victorian College of the Arts. His work leans toward grounded thrillers and dramas — character‑driven stories with the themes of memory, identity and the search for meaning. He writes in a prose‑poetry style, favouring tone and rhythm over structure.</p>
